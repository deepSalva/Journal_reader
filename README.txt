Hi! this is a Headline reader which analyzes the most common words in 4 different Newspapers. 

This is my first project and the code has a "bizarre" syntax. I am aware of it, but I like this because it reminds me how special was programming at the beginning.

However I am working on Version 2, with a more efficient syntax and with some upgrades for data science research.    

If you want to run it you just need to save or clone the repository in your local directory and run the ".py" file with your Shell (Git, Ubuntu, Powershell...)

It shows the results creating a .txt file with os library.

You can change the Newspaper websites just changing the "url" in main() Arguments. And also the names of the newspaper inside start() function, "intro" variable.

This is writed in Python 3
